# x-watchwin
**The classic tool for viewing unauthenticated X-Windows Sessions**

Here is a rare and classic piece of pentesting history for you.
You can find the source (untouched) and compiled binaries (by me) in this repository.

I doubt very much that this will be of much use these days, but as a piece of nostalgia, I hope it amuses a few of you. That said, I did actually manage to use this on an *actual client pentest* in (checks notes) 2016. That's why I compiled a version up. I couldn't believe it worked, but it did! This is why it's always worth hanging on to those old tools kids!

If you do manage to use this in anger anywhere, or compile a version for another platform, I would really appreciate you adding an Issue to this repository to tell me all about it. :)

In the binaries directory, you'll find an ELF binary at present.

I have included the original Readme from version 1.1.1. and a converted the manpage to markdown.
